			<p> Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows.</p>
			<p>Why he left his home in the South to roam 'round the Pole, God only knows.</p>
			<p>He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell;</p>
			<p>Though he'd often say in his homely way that "he'd sooner live in hell."</p>
			<br>
			<p>On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail.</p>
			<p>Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold it stabbed like a driven nail.</p>
			<p>If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn't see;</p>
			<p>It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee. </p><!-- closes text-->
